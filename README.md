### Dependencies:
Requires Max 8 - uses MC objects

## Run:
Open "crystal-cave.maxpat"

## Outline and Score:
Crystal Cave is an instrument driven by 64 sine waves controlled by a window that reacts to mouse movement. 
X movement of the mouse are mapped to the range of random values that the instrument will output. 
Y values of the mouse are mapped to the speed in which the voices will change frequency depending on their available range.
Clicking on the control window will freeze audio and stop alterations to the voices.
The edges of the window cause the most dramatic effect.

Try and generate long tones and introduce slow and careful high voices as you begin.
Move through fast and slow changes with periodic freezes to create structures in the drone.
