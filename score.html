<p>In the Crystal Cave you're followed by a floating crystal globe. As it approaches your eyes and ears are filled with a horrid warmth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crystal Cave is an instrument driven by 64 sine waves controlled by a window that reacts to mouse movement.</li>
<li>X movement of the mouse are mapped to the range of random values that the instrument will output.</li>
<li>Y values of the mouse are mapped to the speed in which the voices will change frequency depending on their available range.</li>
<li>The x position of the crystal controls filter cutoff.</li>
<li>The y position of the crystal controls filter resonance.</li>
<li>The distance from the crystal to the mouse controls the amount of pitch quantization.</li>
<li>Clicking on the control window will freeze audio and stop alterations to the voices.</li>
<li>The edges of the window cause the most dramatic effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Begin at the bottom of the window. Slowly make your way to the top. Apply intermittent freezes and adjust the crystal speed and attraction controls. At the peak, allow the crystal to rest on the mouse.</p>
